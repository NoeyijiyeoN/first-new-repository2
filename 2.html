            Dog food</span> is food specifically formulated and intended for consumption by <span class=js>dogs</span> and other related canines. <span class=js>Dogs</span> are considered to be omnivores with a carnivorous bias. They have the sharp, pointed teeth and shorter gastrointestinal tracts of carnivores, better suited for the consumption of meat than of vegetable substances, yet also have ten genes that are responsible for starch and glucose digestion, as well as the ability to produce amylase, an enzyme that functions to break down carbohydrates into simple sugars â€“ something that obligate carnivores like cats lack.[1] <span class=js>Dogs</span> evolved the ability living alongside humans in agricultural societies, as they managed on scrap leftovers and excrement from humans.[2][3][4]
<span class='js'><span class=js>Dogs</span></span> have managed to adapt over thousands of years to survive on the meat and non-meat scraps and leftovers of human existence and thrive on a variety of foods, with studies suggesting <span class=js>dogs</span>' ability to digest carbohydrates easily may be a key difference between <span class=js>dogs</span> and wolves.[1]
The dog food recommendation should be based on nutrient suitability instead of dog's preferences. Pet owners should consider their dog's breed, size, age, and health condition and choose food that is appropriate for their dog's nutritional needs.[5]
